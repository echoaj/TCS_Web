                    <h2>Why is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
                    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and 
                        typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's 
                        standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown 
                        printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a 
                        type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, 
                        but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining 
                        essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with 
                        the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
                        and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus 
                        PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

                    <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
                    <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the 
                        readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using 
                        Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, 
                        as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like 
                        readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors 
                        now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 
                        'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. 
                        Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, 
                        sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
