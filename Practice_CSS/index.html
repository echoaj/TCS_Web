    <h1 stlye="text-aline:center">World War II</h1>
    <p>World War II or the Second World War, often abbreviated as WWII or WW2, 
        was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. It involved the vast 
        majority of the world's countries—including all of the great powers—forming 
        two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers. In a total 
        war directly involving more than 100 million personnel from more than 
        30 countries, the major participants threw their entire economic, 
        industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the 
        distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a 
        major role in the conflict, enabling the strategic bombing of population 
        centres and the only two uses of nuclear weapons in war to this day. 
        World War II was by far the deadliest conflict in human history, and 
        resulted in 70 to 85 million fatalities, a majority being civilians. 
        Tens of millions of people died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), 
        starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of the Axis defeat, Germany 
        and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against 
        German and Japanese leaders.</p>
