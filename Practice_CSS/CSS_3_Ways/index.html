                <p style="text-align: center;">
                    World War II or the Second World War, often abbreviated as WWII or WW2, was a global war 
                    that lasted from 1939 to 1945. It involved the vast majority of the world's countries—including all of the great 
                    powers—forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers. In a total war directly involving 
                    more than 100 million personnel from more than 30 countries, the major participants threw their entire economic, 
                    industrial, and scientific <img src="image.jpg" style="width: 200px; margin: auto; display: block;"> capabilities 
                    behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major 
                    role in the conflict, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and the only two uses of nuclear weapons 
                    in war to this day. World War II was by far the deadliest conflict in human history, and resulted in 70 to 85 million 
                    fatalities, a majority being civilians. Tens of millions of people died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), 
                    starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of the Axis defeat, Germany and Japan were occupied, and war crimes 
                    tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.
