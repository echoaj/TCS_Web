AJAX    (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML)
Now a days people rarely use XML
AJAJ    (Asynchronous JavaScript and JSON)
JSON    (JavaScript Object Notation)

JSON is very similary to java objects but they actually have nothing to do with them.
One rule that json files must have is that keys must be a double quoted string not single quotes.
Keys in json can't be anything other than a double quoted string and values for example can't be
undefined or null.
